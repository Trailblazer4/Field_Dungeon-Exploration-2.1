ideas for moving locations


to start off, we've dealt with entering a battle from the overworld.

we now need to save the current location of the party,
relative locations and directions of the party members,
and the world location on the map

when the battle ends the party should be returned to this location
this info should be processed somehow with GameData perhaps, cuing up location info
and altering location, but the location info should be stored within a data structure:
LocationInfo

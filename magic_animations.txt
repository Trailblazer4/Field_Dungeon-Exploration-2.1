I want to make a class to generalize/contain magic animations.

Magic animations can start in a places:
	- start at player and shoot toward target (fireball)
	- start at target and stay there (ice block summoned around them,
	pillar of fire surrounding them.)
	- start in the middle of the screen? (black hole sucks everything in)
	- causes a screen effect (Ultima from FFVII)

This class is:
	Node2D
	|	AnimationPlayer
	|	Variant
where the Variant is decided by a selected enum.

The enum tells us whether it is a shot, stationary, or middle.

Have a second enum to determine single- or multi-target (get more into this later,
focus on first part first).

enum SpellAnim {
	SHOT,
	STATIONARY,
	MIDDLE
}

var start # describes what position to start at
var fin # describes what position to travel to

var subject # the object being animated. may be a particle system for fire,
			# a sprite for representing ice, etc.
